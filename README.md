# Blackjack Game
This is my first ever java project in which I've learned some
simple OOP concepts, and also I've learned about AWT, being my
first time working with graphical user interface. It is a simple
blackjack game with a database (containing registered users and
some relevant statistics - win percentage, "money" won).
